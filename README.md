# Auro Queue
==========

A queue management system for Auroville. Build with modern open source technologies. 

## The Goal:
Create a simple queue management system for the Auroville Financial Services. Made to run on a Raspberry Pi together with a switch for token handout and screen to display queue status and other pluggable widgets. 

## The Stack:

**Javascript** - Almost the whole application is build with Javascript. ES2015 aka ECMAScript 6 is used for its invaluable syntactic sugar making the code readable.

**Node.js** - Because it's fast, easy to get started, and ubiquitous. Version 4.* LTS is used for long term support, stability and security.

**Hapi** - A very well designed server framework that is easy to understand, and most importantly well documented.  Used in production by Yahoo, Walmart, Paypal and many others.

**Pure.css** - A tiny responsive css framework to make developers look like they have an idea about design.

### Requirements:
Install Node.js by following the following guide [http://blog.wia.io/installing-node-js-v4-0-0-on-a-raspberry-pi/](following guide).

After Node.js is installed, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.


Start the server by running the command:
```
$ npm start
```

Now all of your server html and js files are being watched and on change the node server gets restarted automatically.

#### Premature Optimizations
> "Premature optimization is the root of all evil‚Äù
It is always so tempting. Great efforts have been made to avoid these. A proper build system, minification, uglification etc. are not here for a reason.


#### Folder Structure
There are two main folders in the stack. The "**public**" folder for front-end (client side) code. All files within are served under the path `/public/`

The "**server**" folder contains server side code with the exception of the `server.js` file in the root.
